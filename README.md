# AWS Architecture Deployment Manager

This project is a **React** and **Flask** application that facilitates deploying **customizable cloud architectures** on AWS. The primary goal of this project is to provide an intuitive interface for users to define their requirements and deploy **Microservice**, **Monolithic**, or **Lightsail** architectures to host a WordPress website. By leveraging **Terraform**, this application enables a dynamic, user-driven approach to infrastructure deployment while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

The project exemplifies modern DevOps principles by integrating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), cloud automation, and user-driven configuration management.

## Nature of the Project

### Purpose
The core aim of this project is to simplify the process of deploying AWS resources. Hosting a WordPress website requires specific configurations, and this project automates the setup by allowing users to:

1. **Select architectural styles**:
   - **Microservice**: Deploys multiple interconnected services for WordPress, such as separate EC2 instances for the application and database.
   - **Monolithic**: A single EC2 instance hosting both the application and database.
   - **Lightsail**: A cost-effective, simplified deployment for WordPress using AWS Lightsail.

2. **Customize deployment configurations**:
   - Define EC2 instance types, database engines, OS images, storage sizes, and more.
   - Select regions and security settings based on user preferences.

### How It Works
- **Frontend (React)**: Provides an interactive UI where users can select their deployment preferences.
  - Example inputs:
    - Architecture type
    - AWS region
    - EC2 instance type
    - RDS database engine
    - PHP version
    - Security group and storage settings
  - User selections are dynamically updated in Terraform `.tfvars` files via the backend.

- **Backend (Flask)**: Handles user input, dynamically modifies Terraform files, and triggers Terraform commands to provision the infrastructure.

- **Terraform Integration**: Automates the deployment of AWS resources based on user configurations.

- **AWS Cognito**: Provides user authentication and ensures secure access to the deployment tool.

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Monitors and logs user activities for auditing and troubleshooting.

## Features

### Key Capabilities
1. **Dynamic Infrastructure Deployment**:
   - Modify Terraform files in real time based on user input.
   - Deploy scalable architectures efficiently.

2. **Architecture Types**:
   - **Microservice**: Independent EC2 instances for application and database.
   - **Monolithic**: All-in-one EC2 instance.
   - **Lightsail**: Simplified deployment using AWS Lightsail for WordPress hosting.

3. **User-Driven Configuration**:
   - Select regions, EC2 instance types, database types, and storage sizes.
   - Define PHP versions and security groups.

4. **Authentication and Monitoring**:
   - Secure login with AWS Cognito.
   - Activity tracking with AWS CloudTrail.

### Example User Input
Reactâ€™s `useState` hooks are used to capture user preferences. For instance:
```javascript
const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState('');
const [selectedPortValue, setSelectedPortValue] = useState('');
const [PopupRegion, popupsetRegion] = useState(''); // AWS Region
const [PopupOSImage, popupsetOSImage] = useState(''); // OS Image
const [PopupEC2, popupsetEC2] = useState(''); // EC2 Instance Type
const [PopupKeyPair, popupsetkeyPair] = useState(''); // Key Pair
These inputs update Terraform variables such as:

selectedregion = "us-east-1"
selectedec2InstanceType = "t1.micro"
selectedrdsDBType = "aurora-mysql"
selectedsshoption = "22"
selectedkeypairoption = "None"
selectedphpversion = "8.0"
selectedstoragesize = "20"
